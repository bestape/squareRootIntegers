# Volatility-Aware Ticks in AMMs (Solidity Experiment)

# NOTE

This is a first draft with AI. It is a minimum viable demo by an individual inventor meant to encourage others to get involved academically or in industry.

This README, with active links locally at [Volatility-Aware Ticks in AMMs (Solidity Experiment).pdf](Volatility-Aware\ Ticks\ in\ AMMs\ \(Solidity\ Experiment\).pdf) and globally at [https://chatgpt.com/s/dr_68ba59016a54819190f1d62a7086ee8f](https://chatgpt.com/s/dr_68ba59016a54819190f1d62a7086ee8f), analyzes how our Solidity prototype – which uses Newton’s method to compute fractional exponents on-chain – could inform automated market maker (AMM) design, especially in concentrated-liquidity pools. In Uniswap-style AMMs, each “tick” is a fixed price step: by convention 1 tick = 0.01% price change (a 1.0001× multiplier)【7†L118-L127】【9†L38-L45】.  The contract’s ability to compute such fine-grained exponents (for example, using inputs like `(1, 10001, 2)` to approximate the factor 1.0001) means we can generate small price increments on-chain. Below we discuss how tick spacing might vary by token type, and how Newton’s single-sequence iterations (unlike Pell-Lucas methods) make these calculations practical.

## Tick Spacing and Token Characteristics

AMMs can **tune tick granularity** to match token volatility and liquidity.  Each tick step corresponds to a price ratio (Uniswap uses \(p(i)=1.0001^i\))【9†L38-L45】.  Narrow tick spacing (small percentage steps) boosts precision, while wider spacing reduces the number of steps crossed for large price moves.  General guidelines are: 

- **Stablecoin / low-volatility pairs:** Use very *narrow* ticks (fine granularity).  Since stable pairs stay near a constant price, tighter spacing concentrates liquidity where trades happen【7†L139-L147】【15†L203-L208】.  Narrow spacing (e.g. 1-basis-point, 0.01% steps) improves capital efficiency and lowers slippage【7†L139-L147】【15†L203-L208】.
- **High-volatility assets:** Use *wider* ticks (coarser steps) to avoid frequent tick-crossing.  For a highly volatile pair, large price swings would otherwise hit many ticks (adding gas cost), so larger steps reduce crossing frequency【9†L74-L82】【18†L208-L213】.
- **High-liquidity pools:** Can tolerate *narrow* spacing.  When a pool has lots of liquidity, LPs can confidently concentrate it in tight ranges, so finer ticks are viable【18†L208-L213】.
- **Low-liquidity pools:** Benefit from *wider* spacing.  With little liquidity, each tick holds less depth; using larger steps avoids having extremely sparse liquidity at each tick【18†L208-L213】.

These principles align with Uniswap’s design: tick spacing is tied to fee tiers and volatility.  For example, Uniswap V3 governance added a 1 bps fee tier with tickSpacing=1 (0.01% steps) to better serve stablecoin pools【9†L132-L140】【15†L203-L208】.  In contrast, high-fee (volatile) pools have larger tick spacing (e.g. 0.3% steps) to balance precision and gas efficiency【9†L132-L140】【18†L208-L213】.  

## Newton’s Method for On-Chain Math

Notably, recent AMM designs use **Newton’s iterative method** on-chain for pricing.  Curve Finance’s StableSwap (and forked versions like Saddle) implement their constant-sum/constant-product hybrid curve using Newton’s method in Solidity【13†L43-L52】.  This demonstrates that even computationally intensive numerical algorithms can run in smart contracts.  Our contract similarly uses a Newton loop to converge on a solution.  Unlike Pell–Lucas or Pell equation approaches (which involve two intertwined sequences of approximations), Newton’s method produces a single sequence of improved estimates.  Each iteration refines one value until convergence.  This simplicity (one sequence of updates) makes implementation straightforward and gas-efficient.

- *Example (Curve StableSwap):* Curve’s code iteratively updates a variable `y` via `y = (y*y + c) / (2*y + b - D)`, which is the Newton step for solving its invariant equation【13†L95-L103】.  That on-chain loop converges to the desired result in a few iterations.  
- *Our approach:* By contrast, our power-function solver takes parameters `(x, n, d)` and applies Newton’s method to compute \(x^{n/d}\).  In practice, a single loop of Newton updates suffices to get high precision.  This is conceptually simpler than Pell-based series (which generate numerator/denominator pairs separately); here we maintain just one estimate that homes in on the answer each step.

## Example: Approximating a 1.0001 Tick

To illustrate, consider approximating the base tick factor 1.0001.  Our contract function can take an input like `(x=1, n=10001, d=2)` to perform a rational exponent calculation.  In effect it computes \(1^{10001/2}\) under fixed-point arithmetic, yielding a result close to **1.0001**.  (In other words, one half-step of the 10001/10000 increment.)  This shows that even tiny multipliers can be encoded: by choosing the numerator and denominator appropriately, the Newton solver generates a value ~1.0001.  In a concentrated-liquidity AMM, such fine control could let LPs specify ranges at the granularity of 0.01% (or even smaller if desired).

The key point is that our implementation handles this in one go.  For example, using the triple input `(1, 10001, 2)` yields the expected tick factor after the Newton iterations.  This flexible power-function mechanism means any rational price step can be approximated on-chain, not just powers of 1.0001.  And since Newton’s iteration is a single convergent sequence, the logic is compact and gas-efficient.

## Implications for AMM Design

In summary, our Solidity experiment demonstrates that *adaptive tick spacing* and *on-chain numeric solvers* can be combined in AMM technology.  AMMs could allow tick size to vary by pool (or even adjust dynamically) based on token volatility or liquidity, beyond the fixed 1.0001 step.  The contract can compute arbitrary rational price ratios via Newton’s method, so implementing custom tick increments (e.g. 0.1% or finer than 0.01%) is feasible.  This opens possibilities such as ultra-tight ticks for stablecoin pools and wider ticks for exotic pairs.  The single-sequence Newton solver ensures these calculations converge reliably in a few steps.  

Overall, concentrating liquidity with volatility-tailored ticks (as Uniswap and Orca doc suggest【15†L203-L208】【18†L208-L213】) and using Newton’s method for on-chain math can enhance AMM efficiency.  Our experiment shows the solidity code can approximate precise price steps (like the 1.0001 tick) and scale to other ratios, potentially allowing new AMM fee/tick configurations tuned to each market’s characteristics.
