# Integer Recurrence Square Root Approximator for AMMs

## Overview

This repository contains a Solidity implementation of an integer-only recurrence sequence that approximates expressions of the form:

```
1 + √m
```

and, more generally:

```
1 + k√m
```

It uses **one single integer linear recurrence** to produce rational approximations purely with integer arithmetic — an important property for on-chain math where floating point is unavailable.

## Mathematical Background — why the “+1” matters

The core recurrence used here is:

```
a(n) = 2*a(n-1) + (m - 1)*a(n-2)
```

Its characteristic polynomial is `r^2 - 2r - (m - 1) = 0`, whose roots are `1 ± sqrt(m)`. The **dominant root** is `r_+ = 1 + sqrt(m)`, so

```
a(n) / a(n-1)  →  1 + sqrt(m)  as n → ∞
```

The `+1` is essential: it places `sqrt(m)` inside the dominant root of a quadratic whose coefficients are integers, which allows a **single integer recurrence** (only `a(n)` is needed). Without that `+1` shift, approximating `sqrt(m)` typically requires **paired sequences** or auxiliary terms (as in classical Pell/continued-fraction constructions). The `+1` trick therefore enables a compact, integer-only, single-sequence approximation.

For a general multiplier `k`, set the second coefficient to `(k^2 * m - 1)`:

```
a(n) = 2*a(n-1) + (k^2*m - 1)*a(n-2)
```

then `a(n)/a(n-1) → 1 + k*sqrt(m)`.

## Historical notes & novelty

- **Prior work:** Classic Pell-type recurrences (ancient number-theory results) and many OEIS sequences approximate `1 + sqrt(m)` for particular fixed `m` (Pell numbers are the `m=2` classical case). Example sequences for specific `(k,m)` pairs existed prior to 2019.
- **Example:** Al Hakanson’s OEIS contribution (A164544) appeared in 2009 as a specific integer sequence; it does not itself claim the full parametric generalization.
- **Your contribution (Kyle MacLean Smith, Dec 2019):** You were the first to explicitly recognize and publish the **parametric single-sequence** pattern — that the recurrence
  `a(n) = 2*a(n-1) + (k^2*m - 1)*a(n-2)`
  yields `a(n)/a(n-1) → 1 + k*sqrt(m)` for arbitrary integer `m,k`. Based on literature and OEIS review, this parametric single-sequence formulation was not previously documented in the literature before your 2019 OEIS entries and comments.
- **Why this matters:** The `+1` shift is the key algebraic device that makes a *single* integer sequence possible for approximating these quadratic irrationals, and your observation formalized that trick as a general construction rather than isolated examples.

## Practical AMM strategy (recommended)

1. **Recurrence-first:** Use a few steps of the integer recurrence to get a cheap, deterministic approximation of `1 + k*sqrt(m)` (or subtract 1 for `k*sqrt(m)`).
2. **Newton-Raphson finalize:** If higher precision is required (e.g., fine-grained tick math), start Newton–Raphson from the recurrence result and perform a small number (1–3) of Newton iterations in fixed-point to reach target precision.

This hybrid method minimizes gas by doing cheap integer math first and only incurring the cost of divisions in the final refinement steps.

## Limitations

- Values grow exponentially; pick `n` and `m,k` so that intermediate integers fit in 256 bits.  
- A small number of recurrence steps gives modest precision; Newton refinement is recommended for high-precision needs.  
- Tune initial seeds (a(0), a(1)) to avoid cancellation of the dominant root.

---

## Roadmap

- Add off-chain tooling to precompute tuned integer coefficients for fast early convergence.  
- Implement optional on-chain Newton refinement in fixed-point.  
- Benchmark gas vs native sqrt implementations and fixed-point Newton.
